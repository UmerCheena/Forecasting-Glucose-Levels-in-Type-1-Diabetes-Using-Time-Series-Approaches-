## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this study is to employ deep learning time series models to predict blood glucose levels in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). 
By predicting glucose levels 30 minutes in advance, Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data can assist patients and physicians in taking preventative measures against potentially harmful bouts of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
Analyse 200 T1D patients' CGM data in an exploratory manner.
Construct and assess three deep learning models: CNN, GRU, and LSTM
MAE, RMSE, and R2 measures are used to compare model performance.
Determine which short-term glucose predicting model is the most accurate.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Clinical CGM dataset — 200 Type 1 Diabetes patients
- **Total Readings:** 647,858 glucose readings
- **Sampling Rate:** Every 5 minutes (continuous)
- **Target Variable:** Blood glucose level (mg/dL)
- **Features:** Demographics, clinical history, medications, comorbidities

### Glucose Zone Distribution:
| Zone | Range | Count | Percentage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Hypoglycemia | < 70 mg/dL | 48,839 | 7.5% |
| 🟢 Normal | 70–180 mg/dL | 333,033 | 51.4% |
| 🟠 Hyperglycemia | > 180 mg/dL | 265,986 | 41.1% |
